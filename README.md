## Distributed Hash Table with Join and Remove Node

One of the biggest problem with the distributed system is to locate/lookup particular file on various nodes in distributed system. We try to solve this problem is quicker way by defining chord.

## What is chord?

- It a peer to peer lookup system.
- Given a key, it maps key to one of the node
- Each node is assigned at key using consistent hashing function
- So, this consistent hashing function will assign each node a key which is m bit identifier
- A nodes's IP address and port number is used to calculate key or identifier
- So, in a m bit identifier space, there will be 2^m identifiers
- So, all these identifiers are ordered on identifier circle of modulo 2^m.
- This identifier ring is called chord ring
- So, the key k is assigned to first node on the in the ring whose identifier equal to or follows key
- Let's imagine m =5 , so we have identifier space starting from  0 to 31. We can imagine that as chord ring. Let's assume there are 3 nodes having identifier 1, 4 and 9. Now, if request to read a file whose identifier is 6 comes to node with identifier 1. 1 will see if it has key, if not it will go to 4 and so on. So, the system will visit all nodes on chord on linear order as there is no other rounting info other than successor of node. 
- To accelerate the lookup, chord node maintains a structure called finger table which is of size m
- The ith entry of in the fingertable at node p is successor of (p + 2 ^ i-1) key
- So, the first entry on fingertable is a successor of current node
- Since each node has finger entries at power of two intervals around the identifier circle, each node can forward a query at least halfway along the remaining distance between the node and the target identifier.
